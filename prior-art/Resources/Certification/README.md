### Certification standards

#### PCB

Printed circuit boards are usually certified with Underwriters Laboratories (UL) standards.

A database is available to check a manufacturer for UL certification at: http://database.ul.com/cgi-bin/XYV/template/LISEXT/1FRAME/index.htm

The UL category code to search for:
- Printed Wiring Boards (ZPMV2)
- Flexible Printed Wiring Boards (ZPXK2)
- Laminates (QMTS2)
- Printed Wiring Boards (QMJU2)

Parameters:
- Flame class
- Maximum operating temperature (MOT)
- Direct Support Requirements (DSR)
- Comparative Tracking Index (CTI)
- Multiple Solder Limits

Tests:
- UL94 - [Standard for Tests for Flammability of Plastic Materials for Parts in Devices and Appliances
Purchase UL 94

Material:
- [UL PCB Recognition](https://www.ncabgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/UL-Emma-Hudson-NCAB-Seminar-2015-03.pdf)


#### Specification
- [MIL-PRF-38535 United States military specification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIL-PRF-38535)

#### Manufacturing

- [IPC-A-610 Acceptability of Electronics Assemblies Training and Certification Program](http://www.ipc.org/ContentPage.aspx?pageid=IPC-A-610)
- Solder Paste Inspection, Automated Optical Inspection and X-ray examination are all carried out during manufacture followed by PCB testing and finally burn in testing 

#### Quality
- [ISO 9001:2015](https://www.iso.org/iso-9001-quality-management.html)
